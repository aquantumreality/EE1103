# Normal distributions

 - Generate a sine wave x  as an array of points x[N]
   - Take in 3 arguments as argv: amplitude, freq, number of cycles (M)
   - Choose 3<P<10 number of points per cycle such that N = M*P
 - Generate and add Gaussian noise to create the noisy sine wave y[N]
   - Choose mean = 0, stdev = 0.1 Vpp
   - Use the Box-Muller transform to convert from a uniform distribution to a normal distribution
 - Estimate the error e = y - x  for all N points and determine
   - Mean and stdev (sigma) of the error distribution
   - Tabulate the statistics: what % of points lie within 2*sigma, 4*sigma and 6*sigma of the mean?
 - Choose a random mean,  |mu| ~ 0.1*Vpp,  stdev = 0.2 Vpp and repeats steps 1 to 3
   - How do your choices of P and mu affect the observed statistics of e?
