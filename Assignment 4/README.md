# A4 : Regression

Identify the threshold voltage for the semiconductor device, from its I-V characteristics
- Read the data from the datafile. 
- Start with one curve (Vg11), and find Vth. You can use any suitable method 
  - linear fits to the low and high voltage parts of the graph
  - start with some value of Vth and try to minimize the RMS error from the linear fits by search for a better Vth
  - fitting all the data to a model curve e.g.  I = I0*(1-exp(-V/V0)
- Repeat the exercise for the different data columns in the datafile and finally plot Vth versus Vg
