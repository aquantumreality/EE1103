# Numerical Integration

- Integrate M cycles of a noisy sine wave and compare the convergence of the integration using the midpoint (M), trapezoid (T) and Simpson's 1/3 rule (S) for different number of intervals (n)
- Remember to 
  - take in as arguments to main the values of M (cycles) and N (pts per cycle)
  - write 3 separate functions for each integration method, and call them sequentially from within main()
  - output 4 columns of data (n, M, T, S)
  - check for convergence as you increase n from 4 points per cycle to N points per cycle, and exit the program after all 3 methods have converged

- Extra credit: Compare the convergence of M,T and S methods against the more advanced Romberg Quadrature (C code is in the Implementation here
