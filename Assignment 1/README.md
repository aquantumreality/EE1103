# A1: Distributions

The learning objectives here are

   - to use srand(), time() and rand() to generate a uniform distribution of random numbers
   - to understand the different types of probability distributions that we encounter in engineering i.e. Binomial, Exponential, Normal (or Gaussian), and Poissonian.
   - learn how to use available codes - download, compile and run a suite of tests
   - plotting using gnuplot

## Assignment

   - Take two inputs from the command line (N and distribution_name), generate N random numbers
   - Estimate the value of pi using 2*N random numbers (N along x, N along y) in the range -1 to 1, and counting the number of points that fall within a circle of radius 1.
   - Plot the error = abs(your estimate - pi) versus N
        Remember to label the axis on the plot correctly
   - Repeat the exercise for another distirbution of random numbers
   - Optional: Determine the histogram of your other distribution (graphical representation of their probability distribution)
